            <p class='lower'>Hey! My name is Duvauwn and I'm a web developer with a passion for front-end development. I
                have always had a
                love for problem-solving. With web-development I am always learning new things and I can immediatley
                implement them into my own projects. I'm a gamer at heart and my ability to go through tough
                time-intensive
                issues comes from that.

                </a>
                <p>In developing this app I hoped to create a space for me to record books that I have read or have yet
                    to read. Books that have been on the back-burner for a while now. By creating this personal library
                    I wass able to catalog those books and choose ones that I had been meaning to read for some time
                    now.</p>

                </a>
                <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game that I remember playing as a kid. I wanted something to be able to show
                    my younger siblings what the power of web development can do. What better than making something they
                    play all the time into a web application they can play whenever they want.</p>

                </a>
                <p>I don't know how many times I have needed a calculator but didnt have one on hand. This project was
                    made expressly for this purpose. In developing this page I learned quite a bit about Javascript and
                    how powerful it can be</p>

                </a>
                <p>This etch-a-sketch game is part skecthbook and part game. This is something I would have njoyed
                    playing when I was younger so that's why I made it.</p>

                </a>
                <p>As a Jamaican I love to be able to share my culture whenever possible so being able to share the food
                    I grew up with was a no-brainer.</p>

                <p>I love coffee. I wouldn't be productive without it and it tastes amazing. I know many people agree so
                    that's why I decided to make this landing page for it. This is my ode to coffee.</p>
